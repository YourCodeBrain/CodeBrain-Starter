# 1-Projects · Active Initiatives

Use this folder to track workstreams that require multiple steps or collaborators.

## Suggested layout
- One markdown file per project (`project-acme-website.md`).
- Start each file with a brief YAML header (owner, status, deadline).
- Include sections for goals, tasks, meeting notes, and links to resources.

## Gemini CLI tips
- `gemini summary 1-Projects/project-name.md` – quick status digest.
- `gemini query "What tasks remain for Project X?"`

Archive finished projects into the `Archives/` folder to keep this list focused.
