# Templates

This starter pack leaves the `Templates/` folder empty so you can build your own prompts and note scaffolds.

We recommend:

- Mirror the folders you use most (`0-Inbox`, `1-Projects`, etc.)
- Save reusable markdown snippets (checklists, agendas, briefs)
- Keep filenames lowercase-with-dashes so they are easy to reference via Gemini CLI

For inspiration, check the CodeBrain Pro Kit or the community library and adapt what fits your workflow.
