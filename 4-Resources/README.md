# 4-Resources · Knowledge Base

Collect evergreen material: SOPs, research, frameworks, reference articles.

## Tips
- Organize with prefixes or tags (e.g., `resources-sop-client-onboarding.md`).
- Link resources to the projects or clients they support.
- Add summaries at the top so future-you knows why the note matters.

## Gemini CLI usage
- `gemini query "Which notes mention onboarding?"`
- `gemini summary 4-Resources/sop-onboarding.md`

Keep this folder tidy—when a resource becomes outdated, archive or refresh it.
