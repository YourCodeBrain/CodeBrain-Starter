# Archives · Completed Work

Move finished projects, retired client notes, and old resources here. This keeps the main folders focused on current work.

Consider adding an `Archived` tag or note at the top explaining why the item was archived and when.

When revisiting a topic, pull the file back into the active folder and update it with fresh context.
