# 2-Clients · Relationships & Meetings

Store one note per client or account. Capture history, contact info, open opportunities, and next steps.

## Suggested sections
- Overview & key contacts
- Current engagements / deliverables
- Meeting notes (with dates)
- Follow-up tasks

## Gemini CLI tips
- `gemini summary 2-Clients/client-name.md` – prep before a call.
- `gemini rewrite ... --style="email"` – draft follow-up emails.

Move inactive clients into `Archives/` when the relationship is dormant.
