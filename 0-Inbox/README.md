# 0-Inbox · Quick Capture

**Purpose:** temporary landing zone for new thoughts, meetings, ideas, and raw transcripts. Review it regularly and graduate each note to its long-term folder.

## How to use
- Drop quick notes, web clips, and meeting bullets here.
- If you capture via voice or mobile, save the transcript into this folder.
- Add a short heading or tag so you remember why the note matters.

## Processing routine
1. **Capture** throughout the day.
2. **Review** during your daily shutdown or weekly review.
3. **File** into `1-Projects`, `2-Clients`, `4-Resources`, etc.
4. **Link** related notes using Markdown links (`[[note-name]]`).

## Inbox zero tips
- Keep filenames descriptive (`2025-09-15-client-intro-call.md`).
- If an item spawns tasks, move those tasks into your project note or daily plan.
- Archive what’s complete so the inbox stays lean.
