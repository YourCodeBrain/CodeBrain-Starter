# 3-Daily · Plans & Logs

Create a note for each day to plan, journal, or log progress.

## Suggestions
- Filename format: `2025-09-18-daily.md`
- Sections: priorities, schedule, key wins, lessons, tomorrow’s focus.
- Use checkboxes (`- [ ] Task`) to track progress.

## Gemini CLI tips
- `gemini summary 3-Daily/2025-09-18-daily.md` – end-of-day reflection.
- `gemini rewrite ... --style="bullet"` – clean up messy notes.

Review these notes during weekly or monthly retrospectives.
